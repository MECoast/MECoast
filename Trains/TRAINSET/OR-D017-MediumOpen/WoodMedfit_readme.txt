BR Diagram 017 13Ton 3Plank Medfit Wagons.

Model ........Ian Macmillan.
Textures....Ian Macmillan.


Prototype.

Introduced in 1950 these wagons were a continuation of the LMS 3 plank wagons.  397 were built at Wolverton. They were intended to have 2shoe Morton handbrakes but many were fitted with vacuum brakes from new and others were converted later.
They were intended to carry crates and containers as well as heavy minerals but this traffic soon went over to more specialised wagons and most were turned over to the engineers where they were ideal for ballast and spoil.

A selection of loads are included. More loads and instructions for adding the are included in the full common.loads folder.


Repaints are allowed but please inform me first before uploading.
Please seek permission before uploading repaints or including this wagon or any repaint on a CD...I might have an upgraded version.
The wagon may not be included on any payware CD without giving me lots of money.
