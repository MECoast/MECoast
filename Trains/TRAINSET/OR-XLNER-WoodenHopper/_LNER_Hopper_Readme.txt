PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~~
The North Eastern Railway favoured hopper wagons for the transport of coal to the north sea ports. it extended their use by building raised coal drops at goods yards for house coal, the quick turn round of wagons justifying the expense.

When the need to replace earlier wagon came in 1930, the LNER continued the practice with a new design of 8 plank hopper based on current RCH standards for 12ton coal wagons with a 16ft6in by 8ft body but with a 10ft6in wheelbase to clear the hopper doors.
This was given diagram 72. 2400 were built.
In 1938 the design was slightly altered to make the bottom two planks slope inward towards the solebars following the internal planking and 3000 were built.
Finally in 1944 the whole side was made sloping. 3400 being built to diagram 193.
This as not the end. In 1949 BR built a further batch of 500 to their diagram 140. These were the only BR wagons built with wooden underframes.

To cater for the export market and large industry, a high cappacity version was built. these were 20ft long and 10ft high and identical to the NER P7 design but with steel end stanchions. 7175 to diagram 12 were built from 1923 until the introduction of the steel hopper in 1935.
For collieries with low clearance, 1850 were built to Diagram 11 with a lower hight matching the shorter D 193.

Almost all survived into BR ownership.

Due to the lack of discharge facilities these wagons rarely strayed from the NER area.
An exception was the Cumbrian coast where the Furness Railway also used hoppers.

When BR extended the use of the steel hoppers, a few of the large examples got mixed in and were seen in other areas.
 

THE MODELS
~~~~~~~~~~

Models of all 5 designs are included plus an exra diagram 193 (there was unused space on the texture)

It was common practice for the loco to position these wagons and wait the few minutes it took to unload before taking away the empty.
To facilitate this in MSTS I have included disappearing load versions.
With MSTSbin installed, Press Ctrl and numberpad 7 and the load will disappear. press again and it will re-appear.
Wagons sufixed _anE start in the sim as empty, _anL start as loaded.
