BR Static Vans.
18 of the most common vans in BR livery.
Models and textures by Ian Macmillan.

With thanks to all the model builders who gave permission for images of their models to be used as a basis.

Version two upgrades the underframe. 



These are very low poly wagons intended for placing as static consists to fill up your yards in activities.

They average about a tenth of the full poly vans.
This lets you fill the sidings without greatly reducing frame rates.
Or use a hundred where you could only get away with ten.

As they are fully working wagons, they can also be used in AI trains.

The easiest way to use them is to make a simple activity to place the wagons as static consists in the sidings along your route. Add a fast player loco and a path to check it and save it.

You can then use the activity as a basis for a proper activity by renaming it. Move the static arround a bit each time to make each activity look different.

You can make things easier by renaming your Trains folder and using the Static Trains folder instead. This will make it easier to find things.
I have included a few demo consists to get you started.
Use Conbuilder to create more. There is a random consist maker function which is ideal for this.

When you are finished, rename the folders back.
MSTS only uses the static consists to make the activity file so there is no need for them to be included in the main consist folder.


INSTALLATION.

Place the Static Trains folder in the main MSTS folder.
Open it and COPY the contents of the Static_Trains/Trainset folder into the Trains/Trainset folder.
Allow to overwrite if asked.

If you want a look at the wagons, make a consist. they can be used like normal wagons.

The wagons have automatic couplings and mostly vacuum brakes but this should not cause problems as they are not intended to be shunted.
