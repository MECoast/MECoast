HISTORY
~~~~~~~
250 of these vans were built at Wolverton in 1953. They were highly insulated and zinc lined which added to the weight and reduced the capacity to 10 ton. 
They lost out to road competition by the late sixties and were demoted to normal traffic.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Unzip to a temporary folder and copy cut or drag to your Trainset folder.

You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you 
have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
