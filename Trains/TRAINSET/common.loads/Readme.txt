HISTORY
~~~~~~~
Based on the earlier 1st Generation Freightliner wagons introduced during the 1960's used by BR and still in use today with Freightliner LTD
They normally run as 5 Car sets with a FGA 'Outer' on each end, with 3 FFA in between but some times run with less, but with
always a FGA 'outer' on the end for the Buffers and coupling hooks, as the FFA only have "BAR" coupling.
The introduction of the Eurotwin wagons led to withdrawal of some of the FFAs with the FGAs being formed into twins.
 
Loadable Deck Length 60 feet, is capable of carrying 1 x 40' and 1 x 20' containers or 2 x 30' containers or 3 x 20' containers.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Unzip to a temporary folder and you should find two folders.
Copy or move the folder FFA_FGAblack+60ftCont into the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory.
( Normally - Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET

Similarly copy or move the folder Common.loads. If you already have a common.loads folder say yes to the pop up. It will simply add the container loads.
 
You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.
Remember to Place FGAs on the front and end of your consist.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you 
have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

Many Thanks

David Kimber
