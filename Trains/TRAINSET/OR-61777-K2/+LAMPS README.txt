This model features a full set of headcode lamps 
that the user can define by the simple copying and pasting of two files.

Within the loco folder structure ( FBD0008_K2_61777 ) is a 
sub folder labeled +LAMPS, within this folder are ten 
more folders, Class1-Class10.

In each of these folders is a lamp texture with the respective 
lamps alpha'd out to show only those lamps associated with that 
class of train, there is also a replacement eng file to give the 
night light flickering oil lamp effect.

All the user has to do is simply decide which class of train they
wish to run, navigate to the respective folder and then copy the 
two files in there, these need to be then pasted into the main 
folder ( FDB0008_K2_61777 ) and overwrite the files when requested.

IT IS IMPORTANT to make sure that the class folder contents remain 
intact, DO NOT drag and drop the files or else they will be lost for 
ever.

By default the start lamp code is class 10.
