Version 1

Released : 10-06-2006

Model   :  Ian Macmillan.

The first standard open goods wagon built by the LMS was actually a Midland design not built until after the grouping.
They were given diagram 1666 and no fewer than 54,450 were built between 1923 and 1927 making them the most numerous single design of any company other than mineral wagons. This works out to about 150 per week! All had 9ft wheelbase and double brake.
At the same time a steel underframe version was being built by outside contractors to diag 1667 totalling 8000.

Since these wagons were common user they could be seen anywhere carrying anything that would fit. You were more likely to see one on the Southern than see one of the SR's own designs.

In 1934 the design was upgraded to 10ft wheelbase and the doors had the bottom plank angled outwards to give a smaller gap when opened. Diagram 1895 was alotted. 800 were built with double brakes before the design changed again to use Morton 2shoe brakes. 400 were built.
The final lot were 1118 wagons which had L shaped side supports rather than flat castings. These emerged in 1938/9 and were turned out in the new bauxite livery.

Finaly 700 wagons were built in 1934 to diagram 1896 which had the L supports but no curb rail - exposing the floorboards and the full 12inch hight of the solebars. The diagonal strapping was lower and attached to the solebars.
100 of the same design, but without side doors, were built in 1934 for sand traffic and given diagram 1888.

Most of these wagons lasted until the late 50s. Some ended their days carrying a final load of loco coal after which they were broken up at the shed and became kindling. Others went to the Pway as spoil carriers.
