PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~
Fish was an important traffic for the LNER since it served the north sea ports.
To ensure rapid delivery, they were treated as non passenger coaching stock and BR painted them in passenger livery. All were vacuum braked and most had steam heating through pipes.
Fish vans were often attached to passenger trains rather than wait for the local goods. 
Wet fish required dedicated wagons due to the lasting aroma. The first LNER fish vans were ordinary vans converted by simply adding a cast plate.
In 1924 the first dedicated design appeared to diagram 23.
This had outside framing with extra side vents. A wooden underframe was used because of the wet nature of the load but it had only a 9ft wheelbase.
Diagram 37 in 1927 was for 50 long wheelbase van but was not successful and only 50 were built.
A change of design in 1932 resulted in diagram 83. This had flush vertical planks and a 10ft WB. 
No vents were fitted due to the availability of dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) for cooling.
From 1938 the design was modified by increasing the length by 2 foot with a 12ft wheelbase to D134.
A new design with a 21ft body and a 15ft WB was drawn up but was not introduced until nationalisation.
This is available from UKTS file no 15489.
Under BR some D134 vans were fitted with insulation and internal sliding doors similar to the BR bult vans.

The short wheelbase of the D23 vans restricted their speed and saw most of them them demoted to ordinary vans by nationalisation.
The fish traffic gradually reduced in the sixties until lost to road competition by 1970.
