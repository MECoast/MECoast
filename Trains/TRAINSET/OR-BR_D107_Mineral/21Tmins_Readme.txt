All through the last centuary the railway companies tried to get collieries and coal merchants to replace their 10 and 12ton wagons with high cappacity 20ton wagons.
They had little success with the coal merchants but a fleet of privately owned wagons were built for industrial users which ultimately found their way to BR.

At the end of world war two the goverment placed massive orders for 16T wagons to replace the war weary wooden wagons but it was not until nationalisation that a 21ton version appeared. This was a 4door 21ft6in version of the current 16ton wagon.
Like the 16toner both a welded version to diagram 107 and a riveted version to diagram 110 were built concurrently from 1950.

The ideal stocks committee decided that a 25.5t version would be the future standard and in 1953 diagram 115 appeared. Unfortunately few collieries could load such a high wagon nor could industrial users unload it.
Many were stored and a wagon shortage was averted by using 21t loco coal wagons until facilities were rebuilt.
In 1959 an updated version, diagram 118, was ordered with roller bearings.
These wagons usually ran in block trains with the colliery and user painted on the side.

The last orders came in 1961 when a vacuum fitted version of D107 appeared to diagram 119.
This featured top doors above the side doors and had eight shoe brakes, roller bearings and Oleo buffers. Diagram 119 had two vacuum cylinders, the second one being switch in when loaded by manual changover lever.
This was found unreliable and Diagram 120 soon appeared with AFI automatic changover.

By the early 70s the fleet was beginning to wear out and many wagons were replated. An oil crisis saw an upturn in coal traffic and BR decided to built 2600 new bodies on redundant hopper underframes. Most were similar to D107 but there were differences in brake gear. Some used commercial steel sections showing differences in body frames.
A second batch followed but by this time most unloading was by tippler and only one side door was provided. Although unfitted, they were painted in bauxite livery.
Many of the 24.5tonners, being newer, simply had their side doors plated over and the end doors welded shut.
THe fleet soldiered on until Thatcher killed the coal industy.
The last of the vacuum wagons were used to carry their butchered brothers from the scrapyard to the steelworks in the early 90s.

All the above wagons were used by industry. They were rarely seen in coal merchant's yards.
