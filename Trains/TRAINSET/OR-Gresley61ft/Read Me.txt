****NOTE: PLEASE DELETE ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS. THIS IS A MASSIVE UPDATE WHICH RESULTS IN MANY FILES BEING CHANGED.**** 

To delete the previous version:

1) Go to your MSTS Trainset Directory
(usually c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\train simulator\trains\trainset)

2) Search for the folder: Gresley_Coaches_B&C

3) Delete this folder.

This update is a direct replacement which renders alot of the old files pointless.
However none of your consists/activites need to be changed due to the 'wag' files being named the same.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for downlaoding this coach pack.

This pack is updated to V2.

It changes the coach textures to match the other coaches that have been released by me.
All shapes have had work done to them to improve the overall apperance of these coaches.
Whilst no 'wag' file names have been changed the coaches have now been re-'named' in these files.
All consist/activities that you have made will not need changeing.
The SD files have also been updated to make sure that they work correctly.
I have included 1 new coach: the Restaurant Kitchen First.
