BR diagram 507 Long wheelbase Brakevans with through vacuum pipes.

Model    : Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.


Diagram 507 followed on from D506. Roller bearings and Oleo buffers were fitted giving them a top speed of 75 MPH tho they were not much fun at that speed.
 725 were built at Faverdale (ER) between 1959 and 61. They were all fitted with through vacuum pipes.
They were used on fast fitted freights such as the Condor and Blue Spot fish trains.

The models come in versions with no tail lamp, a tail lamp for fitted trains and tail and side lamps for unfitted. These show a white lamp forward to ensure the driver that his train is complete in darkness.  The lamps can be lit with the H key.

A fully detailed interior with a nice warm fire is included. You can view this with the key 5 camera.
