PLEASE READ  !!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TWO Brake Van pack, one ambiguous bauxite/brown suitable for late LMS, or BR use, one in LMS Grey


These are NOT designed as working Wagons!!!!!!!!!  And furthermore, they are NOT detailed wagons to look at at all closely!!!!!!!!!!!!  ................SO, WHY DO them THEN????

Sheds and marshalling yards in steam days were often crowded places...locos and rolling stock everwhere...........simulate that by adding loads of normal or even AI reduced poly locos and MSTS stutters to a stand, even with a powerful processor and graphics card, Right?!!

NOT ANY MORE IT DOESN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One of these "static" Wagons (without moving wheels or any detailed parts) is only at most in the "tens of" polys or so, so feel free to spread them around in sheds and marshalling yards!!!!!!!!  The best use is for distant or "behind others" viewing, using AI reduced poly locos close to your player loco for better detail.

You can use them to match your computer's capability to achieve the graphical detail and density you desire.

For example, on my system, using the excellent Cannock Chase v3 route, I have in an activity placed 25 static locos on Stafford Shed. Using Passenger view 5 or the headout view and a player consist of our Crab and 7 Mk 1 coaches, as I pass by I can "shed spot" from the moving train, and maintain better than 35 frames per second at all times.

Please be aware that these models are not intended to be coupled to anything or moved during Sim use..........but Hey, it's a "Wagon" as far as the Simulator knows, so it can be!  

I have been trialling the draft "static" 7 Plank wagons and Vans in player consists.....a few "real" ones near the loco and guards van if you intend to use it's gurads's eye view, "statics" filling in the bulk of the middle..........you don't see the difference unless you specifically go out of your way to find it.....and at last I have prototypical huge open wagon trains trundling around behind our Garratts..........

Any location where several AI trains are needed at once, and so processor loading creates problems, try this wagon to reduce the PC loading, unless you look very closely you won't see the lack of moving wheels.



THIS ARCHIVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two "Static" Wagons in this archive, LMS Grey large lettering livery and a late Dirty Bauxite livery good for either Late LMS or BR eras.
  
These are called 

£_LMS_Brake_Van       

£_Bauxite_Brake_Van


The use of the "£" symbol identifies a "Static", Mike Simpson has initited using "$" for full complexity but unpowered locos, and the use of the "#" symbol is pretty universal for medium poly AI use.

They all have their uses, these are not only ultra low poly (180 for a 4-6-0 Jubilee), but have simplified and reduced size graphics to ease the processor and graphics engine workloads 


All files inc the graphics follow similar code, so hopefully clashes should be minimised.


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.  



Step 1. In the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory, create a new directory called 

               Static_Brake_Vans

Step 2. Now extract all the files in the archive into this directory.


The models will be then available in the simulator and will appear in the Activity Editor's Cars (FREIGHT) wagon lists.

HOWEVER, like all non-player consists, they will NOT appear in the player consist lists!!

The usual way you will use them will be to use the Activity Editor (AE) to place them as non-player consists onto sidings, etc.  

To do this move the cursor in the track view window over an empty siding, and right click the mouse. A menu opens, use the "Place Consist" option. 


 
LIMITATIONS OF USE AND RESKINS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to play with the graphics, go right ahead.......If you want to use it in activities for uploaded routes and issue it in route CD's, credit us and go right ahead..........subject to the below clauses...

If you think you need other liveries, or the shape is near enough for a similar wagon if the graphics are tweaked (bearing in mind these are background objects!!) go ahead and do them......no need to ask permission.....but follow the rules below please.

The limitations of use we require on our retained copyright for this model are:-

1. We want to know if you intend to upload it, or issue it on a Freeware CD.....no need for permissions, we're just nosey, that's all!!!!   If you are using several in a route CD, a copy of the route would be nice   ;-)

2. Absolutely NO sales for profit of this base model allowed, you may make ONLY the normal Freeware "at cost" issue charge if it's included in any route.

3. Uploading of this model. and any reskins or derivatives must ONLY be made to uktrainsim.com, nowhere else at all.

4. Keep to the naming format please.......



This is one in a (slowly!) growing range of such models........watch this space for more............wagons as well as locos of all sizes. Locos in development now include 4F, Black 5, Jubilee, Patriot, 3FT, 2P, 4P, Duchess, etc.  

We are producing ultra low poly static (and in moving consists away from focus in long trains) wagons and vans, which if possible will pick up our existing wagon or van graphics so can be added to each existing wagon's folder. 


WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
