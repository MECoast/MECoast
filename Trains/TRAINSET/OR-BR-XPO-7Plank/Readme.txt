RCH 1923 standard Seven Plank End Door Mineral Wagon.
Repainter's version.

Model by Ian Macmillan.
Textures by you.


INSTALLATION.


Unzip to a temporary folder.
Drag, Copy or Move the RCH_7pEndDr_Paint folder to your trainset folder.
Drag, Copy or Move the Common.Loads folder to your trainset folder.


Open the RCH_7pEndDr_Paint folder folder and find the consists folder.
Copy the 7plank_End_Door_Demo.con file into your MSTS/Trains/Consists folder.

Ensure you have the default class 50 installed or change it in Route Riter then start MSTS and ensure the consist works.

You will be using this consist to check on your progress as you work.
When you have renamed your repaint, delete this consist.

Now read the instuctions in the "Repainting the 7 Plank_end Door.txt" file.

Have fun.


The folder also contains a demo wagon and a spare unlettered wagon.
You can use the demo just like any other wagon. Please do not include it in an activity...Paint your own!



If you encounter any problems, post first on UK train sim forums rather than emailing.
That way others who share your problem can share the solution using the search function.

The repainted and renamed wagon can be uploaded to UKtrainsim without my permission and included in free or at cost CDs.
Include a readme file so we know who you are.

The RCH_7pEndDr_Paint folder itself may not be uploaded or included on any CD without my prior permission.



Please do not flood the site with repaints. Only the best will get good download counts.
The best way to get good download counts is to write an activity using the wagon.
