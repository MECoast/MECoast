Thank you for downloading this model.

The Q1 class of the LNER was Thompson rebuild of Robinson's GCR Class 8A / LNER Class Q4 0-8-0 tender locomotive. This was a drastic rebuilding but the original frames and cylinders were retained. In order to make room for the cab and bunker the boiler barrel had to be shortened and this placed the firebox over the third axle so raising the boiler in the frames. This version has an extra back water tank to carry 500gal this was the Q1/2 version of which there were 9 locomotives.
