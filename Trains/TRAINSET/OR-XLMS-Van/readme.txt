PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~~

The LMS built 2996 vans to diagram 1891 in 1934/5. 1000 had 8shoe vacuum brake while the remainder had 2 shoe handbrakes. The weight of the door led to a strengthening plank being added behind the runner and this was given diagram 1897. 7500 were built with both vacuum and handbrake only. 2000 Diagram1978 and 1340 Diagram 2039 were outwardly similar.
Wartime shortages led to 440 unfitted vans to diagram 2097 with plywood replacing the side sheeting. These vans did not have the 4 roof vents. These vans were the first to have pressed steel side supports. The top strengthening plank was also extended the full length of the side.
Further wartime shortages led to 2094 vehicles to D2103 with ply ends. Finally the design reverted to steel ends with 1350 vans all with vacuum brakes to D2108. These had diagonal strengthening stripes.

However the story does not end yet.
1300 diagram 2108 were ordered before nationalsation but these emerged as BR diagram 200 with numbers in the BR series. These were followed  by 2050 with the ply replaced by planks to diagram 204.

BR converted almost all of the unfitted wagons to 4 shoe vacuum brakes during the 50s. They also added diagonal stips and removed the roof vents.

4 different vans are included in the pack. I got carried away and modeled all the diagrams so other wagons may pop up on UKTS CDs
