BR Static Mk1s - Maroon livery.
Low poly BR Mk1s based on the models by Ian Morgan.
Models and textures by Ian Macmillan.



These are very low poly coaches intended for placing as static consists to fill up your yards in activities.
They are less than 1 tenth of the polys of the full models and reduce more as you move away.
This lets you fill the sidings without greatly reducing frame rates.
Or use a hundred where you could only get away with ten.


The easiest way to use them is to make a simple activity and place the coaches as static consists in the sidings along your route. Add a fast player loco and a path to check it and save it.

You can then use this activity as a basis for a proper activity by renaming it. Move the static arround a bit each time to make each activity look different.

You can make things easier by renaming your Trains folder and and renaming the Static Trains folder as Trains instead. This will make it easier to find things.
I have included a few demo consists to get you started.
Use Conbuilder to create more.

When you are finished, rename the folders back.
MSTS only uses the static consists to make the activity file so there is no need for them to be included in the main consist folder.


INSTALLATION.

Place the Static_Trains folder in the main MSTS folder.
Open it and COPY the contents of the Static_Trains/Trainset folder into the Trains/Trainset folder.

If you want a look at the coaches, make a consist. they can be used like normal wagons.

The coaches have automatic couplings and mostly vacuum brakes but this should not cause problems as they are not intended to be shunted.
Conbuilder will allow you to make consists with incompatable couplings.
