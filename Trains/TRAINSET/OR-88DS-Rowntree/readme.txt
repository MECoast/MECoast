INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
These files have been tested numerous times without any problems but you install them at your own risk.


Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy reinstallation process


Once downloaded, click on the exe file and follow the instructions on the screen. The wagon will be installed into your trainset folder within MSTS on the C Drive. Important - if your MSTS is installed elsewhere, please alter the drive letter accordingly.


Consist
~~~~~~~

Remember the models will not be available in the simulator without a consist. You can create one with activity Editor supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator or better still use Consist Builder.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and  rolling stock that you have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
