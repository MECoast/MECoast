The Long Low were used to convey loads which were too long for a standard low but their main use was for steel plates altho the Plate designation was not used until 1942.

The first diagram was D1680 for wagons built on ex WD underframes.
This was followed in 1930 by 400 wagons to diagram 1798. These had fixed 12in sides and Morton brakes.
Diagram 1924 was for 1325 wagons built from 1933 to 1940. These were the same 31ft in length but had two part drop sides and lift link brakes.
The Final wood bodied type was D2069. 300 were built in 1942 and these were reduced in length to 27ft - the same length as the LNER steel plate wagon.
The LNER steel design was used for the last batch in 1944 to diagram 2083.


The double bolster wagon had low sides and two bolsters to carry long steel beams and both logs and cut timber. They were 27ft long but often carried longer loads using under-runner wagons. They also found used as under-runners themselves.

The first was Diagram 1674 for 1411 wagons built from 1925. These had morton brakes and low bolsters.
800 to D1949 followed in 1936. These were similar to D1675 but had lift link brakes and higher bolsters. Most of the earier wagons had the bolsters packed out to match the new hight.
The then design changed to that of the contemorary plate wagon. These had removable bolster for dual use. 200 were built in 1942 to D2067.
A final batch of 1050 to diagram 2105 were built using the steel plate wagon design in 1845.

The double bolster began to fall out of favour as loads became longer and by the mid 50s the convertable wagons were being used as plates. Long rows of them sat unused in or near steelworks until eventually scrapped in the 60s.



I have modelled the six main diagrams with wooden bodies and included various loads.
The steel type will follow.
