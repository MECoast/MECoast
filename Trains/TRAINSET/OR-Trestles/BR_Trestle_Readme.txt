BR 4Wheel_Trestle Wagons.
Version 1

Released : 20-10-2015

Model    : Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

Trestle wagons were used to convey Plates which were too wide to be carried flat. A wood or steel frame was fitted to carry the load at an angle and this allowed plates up to 10ft6in. 

The LNER found a need to relace worn out pre=group trestles and planned to rebuild surplus double bolster wagons.
Nationalisation happened before the convertions began but BR continued the program. They also added the identical LMS bolsters.
Both were given LNER diagram 217.

By the mid 50s DR built bolster were converted and given D490.
Finally BR fitted plate wagons were converted in 1958 and recieved D492.

All were withdrawn in the early 80s
