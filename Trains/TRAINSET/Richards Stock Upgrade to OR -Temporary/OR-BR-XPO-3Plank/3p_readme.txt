Low sided wagons were mostly owned by the quarry companies to carry stone and gravel.

Because of the specialised use, they were not taken over during the war nor did they pass to BR in 1948.
However BR was keen to rid itself of PO wagons and bought many of the wagons in the early 50s.
They continued in use at the quarries but more often than not carried ballast and spoil for the Pway dept.
Most were life expired by 1960.
