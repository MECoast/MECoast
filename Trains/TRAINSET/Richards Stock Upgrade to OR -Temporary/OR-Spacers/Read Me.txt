Spacers for creating AI to fill yards and MPDs.

It's always nice to see yards full of wagons or MPDs rammed with steaming locos.
The trouble is that when loose consists start building up then the steam starts to disappear from AI locos and even eventually the player loco.

The way around this is to create "dummy" AI services using the invisible engine and wagons (interspersed with gaps caused by the invisible wagons if required) or for an MPD a string of AI locos separated with these invisible wagons.The idea is to set the start point at one end of the siding, the end point at the other and place a waiting point in between. This should work with a long siding or a long stretch of a yard. 

The AI service should be verified with the time and Play feature in the AE. If the siding is short then sometimes the service goes straight through the waiting point.


This is an extension of something that Ian MacMillan did some time ago to get trains to stop before the end of a platform. It is a collection of 5 invisible wagons of length 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 feet. 

Also included are two invisible AI diesels with no sound or visible effects. One has Chain and the other has automatic coupling.
