BR 13Ton Single Bolster Wagons.

Model ........Ian Macmillan.
Textures....Ian Macmillan.


Prototype.

The single bolster dates back to the origins of the railways. They were little more than a bolster on wheels to carry long loads spread over two or more wagons.
The coming of bogie bolsters took some of the loads from them but as loads got longer they found use as under runners for overhanging loads.
BR inherited large numbers of singles at nationalisation and the few required were a continuation of LNER diagram 197 which were allocated BR diagram 400. These were 15ft 6in long with a wheelbase of 8ft making them the smallest wagons built by BR.
By 1955 many of the earlier wagons were life expired and 3000 more D400 were built.

In 1957 the design was updated with a 10ft wheelbase and given the diagram 402.
2000 were built.
A further update in 1958 saw an 8 shoe fitted version to D405.
By this time the design was redundant and the order was cancelled after 497 were built.

Since these wagons were loaded in pairs all of D405 and some of D402 were permenantly coupled as twin bolsters.
What happened to the odd D405 is not known.

Most of the singles were gone by the late 60s with the twins lasting into the early 70s.
Many found their way into departmental service, mainly as crane runners, or internal use in dockyards where their short length was useful on tight curves.
