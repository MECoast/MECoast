HISTORY
~~~~~~~
This wagon is based on a standard Railway Clearing House (RCH) design, which was used by numerous
builders to provide wagons for the numerous collieries, coal factors and distributors that existed
betwen the wars. Most were painted in the colourful and varied liveries of their owners. After the
sceond world war, they were all taken over by the new British Railways and most were either repainted
BR unfitted grey, or were pretty much down to the bare wood by then and just had small black panels painted on to accomodate the new numbers.

There are 3 different wagons in the folder
3 Empty each with 14 different loads aliased to the common.loads folder

Also included are 6 versions with animated loads which change from loaded to empty and back using MSTSbin and the Ctrl+Numberpad7 or 9.
The wagons suffixed _auE start unloaded and those suffixed auL start loaded.
These wagons will work without the bin patch but the loads will not change.
