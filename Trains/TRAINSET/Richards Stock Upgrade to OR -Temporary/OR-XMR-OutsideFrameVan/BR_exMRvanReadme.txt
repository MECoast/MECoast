Prototype.
----------

The outside framed MR van was first built in 1880.
It was 14ft 11in over headstocks, 10ft high, 9ft wheelbase and rated to carry 8 tons. Brakes were fitted on one side only.
Several similar diagrams were allocated, D353 being the most common.
D356 followed which was 6in higher but this was soon evolved to D357 at 11ft high.
The design changed in 1894 to to a longer 16ft 6in body with 10ft wheelbase. Diagram 362 was allocated. An 8shoe fitted version was also built.
In 1902 Diagram 363 appeared and this was rated at 10 tons however diagram 262 continued to be built. Without seeing the painted cappacity it was impossible to tell the two diagrams apart.
Some of D263 were also built with vacuum brakes.
At some stage a batch of D263 were built with the end diagonals sloping the other way.
Construction of both diagrams ceased in 1916.
Around 1913 brakes began to be fitted on both sides. Earlier vans had a second set of brakes fitted as they passed though works.

The short vans were withdrawn by the mid 30s but some were sold on to minor and industrial railways.
A small batch of D357 were built between 1903 and 1906 and these survived until the late 40s.
the longer vans survived unto the late 1950s.
