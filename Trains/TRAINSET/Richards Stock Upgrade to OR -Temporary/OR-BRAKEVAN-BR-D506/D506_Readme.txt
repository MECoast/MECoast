BR diagram 506 Long wheelbase Brakevans.

Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.


The first BR brake van was built in 1950 and was a development of the post war LNER design with handrails over the end platforms and footsteps extended under them.
The next design was diagram 506. They had 4 pane doors, ply inner ends and continuous handrails. 2855 were built at Faverdale (ER) between 1950 and 58 making them the most common design.
Both piped and unfitted versions were built.

A considerable number of alterations were made during their lifetime and a host of liveries were to be seen.

The model comes in versions with no tail lamp, a tail lamp for fitted trains (not on the unfitted version) and tail and side lamps for unfitted. These show a white lamp forward to ensure the driver that his train is complete in darkness.  The lamps can be lit with the H key.

A fully detailed interior with a nice warm fire is included. You can view this with the key 5 camera.

To allow repaints, I have included PSP selections. See the instructions in my 7plank paintkit wagon to use these.  You can download this from UKTS file 12952.
