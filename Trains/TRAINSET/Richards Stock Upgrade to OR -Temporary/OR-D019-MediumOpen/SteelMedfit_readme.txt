BR Diagram 019 13Ton Steel Medfit Wagons.

Model ........Ian Macmillan.
Textures....Ian Macmillan.


Prototype.

Introduced in 1951 these wagons were an all steel version of the D017 3 plank wagons.  2800 were built at Ashford with LMS running gear  with a further 800 built with 4shoe Morton brakes. All had vacuum brakes.
They were intended to carry crates and containers as well as heavy minerals but this traffic soon went over to more specialised wagons and most were turned over to the engineers where they were ideal for ballast and spoil.

A selection of loads are included. More loads and instructions for adding the are included in the full common.loads folder.


Repaints are allowed but please inform me first before uploading.
Please seek permission before uploading repaints or including this wagon or any repaint on a CD...I might have an upgraded version.
The wagon may not be included on any payware CD without giving me lots of money.
