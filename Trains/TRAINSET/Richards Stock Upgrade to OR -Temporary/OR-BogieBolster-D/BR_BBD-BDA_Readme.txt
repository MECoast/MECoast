BR 42T Bogie Bolster D Wagons.

Version 1
Released 11thFeb 2011

Model and textures by Ian Macmillan.

The first BR BBD was to Diagram 470 which was similar to LMS P18C and was probably a continuation of an existing order.
These had one brake lever each side. Diamand frame bogies and wooded bolsters 150 were built at Derby.
The LNER type was remarkably similar but had steel bolsters and two brake levers per side.
200 were built to diagram 472.
BR continued the LNER design but fitted GW style plate bogies. The diagram number was not changed.
Diagram 476 was identical but had lower stanchions.
Diagram 478 had handbrake wheels at each end but the major change was the fitting of vacuum brake and roller bearings on the plate bogies.
Finally D484 had vacuum brakes with two levers and Gloucester bogies.

In the late 70s 1251 unfitted were rebuilt with air brakes a Y25 bogies. Some kept their original lever brakes and some had handwheels attached to the bogies. The remaining unfitted wagons were scrapped.
By 1984, 283 vacuum wagons had air pipes but they did not outlive their vacuum cousins for long and were gone by the late 80s.
