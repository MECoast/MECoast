RCH 1923 standard 5plank Open Wagon.
BR livery.


Model by Ian Macmillan.


PROTOTYPE

Tens of thousands of these wagon were built for private owners from 1923.
They were requesitioned by the goverment at the start of WW2 and never returned. Instead they passed on the BR at nationalisation.
By the mid 50s they had been replaced by more modern wagons and were gradually withdrawn or passed to the engineers as spoil carriers.

Many had their last journey carrying loco coal. They were then broken up at the shed and used as kindling to light up the locos.
This was usually done by any staff wanting a bit of sunday overtime.
The metalwork was loaded into wagons for the scrapyard but the wheels had to wait until the crain was avalable to lift them.
This explains why there was usually a few wheelsets lying around most sheds.
