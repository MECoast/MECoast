BR Diagram 479 Bogie Bolster E.

Version 1

Released : 23-10-2006

Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

BR built 1200 of these wagons at Ashford in 1961 to repace earlier wagons which were life expired. The steelworks found little use for them, preferring the more flexible longer wagons.
Most were redundant by the 1970s. Some were converted to carry coils or passed to the engineers until the majority were rebuilt as turbots.

The model is supplied with an assortment of typical loads. These include 40ft and 45ft loads which required an underrunner to protect the overhang such as a 1 plank or conflat or indeed another bolster wagon.
