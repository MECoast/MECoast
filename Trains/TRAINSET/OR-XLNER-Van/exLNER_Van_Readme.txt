PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~~
The LNER Covered goods van started as a 17ft 6in wooden body with a wooden 9ft wheelbase. 
Diagram 14 was unfitted.
Diagram 16 was vacuum fitted.

Diagram 15 had an unfitted steel underframe.
Diagram 17 had a steel underframe and vacuum brakes.

All had a similar body. Early vehicles had a sliding shutter on the outside end vent while later builds had the shutter inside.
Construction of all four types was concurrent.
In 1934 diagram 94 appeared. It was similar to D16 but had a 10ft wheelbase.

In the same year a change was made to corrugated steel ends on a 10ft wheelbase vacuum braked steel underframe.
The first was diagram 25 without end vents.
Diagram 102 added the vents.

All the vans so far were 8ft 2in wide.
From Diagram 116 the width was reduce to 8ft to improve siding width restrictions.
D116 was otherwise similar to D102

Due to wartime economies, diagram 171 was similar but without vacuum brakes.

Steel shortages saw a return to wood ends. D161 had vacuum brakes D170 was unfitted.

D172 had a plywood body with U shaped diagonal bracing and was unfitted.
D176 had narrow matchboard sheeting instead of ply.

The last LNER van was D195. It was similar to D172 but with vacuum brakes.

Most of D171, D170. D172 and D176 were given vacuum brakes by BR.

The 9ft WB vans were withdrawn in the 60s. THe 10ft WB vans lasted into the 80s
