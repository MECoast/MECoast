Just an update to include recent additions.

You do not have to download this unless instructed in a wagon readme or if you have lost or deleted your original folder.
My wagons now include their own common.loads in the download.

To reduce the size of the download, I have not included the sd files.
Route builders who wish to use these loads as scenic items should contact me for these files or make their own SD file using Shape File Manager to obtain mesurements..
Wagon builders and repainters are welcome to use these loads in their uploads.

If you add a load to a wagon and use it in an opladed activity, permission is granted to include the wag file in the upload.


Installing.

Unzip to a temporary folder and copy, move or drag to your trainset folder.

This update can be installed over your existing folder - Just allow to overwrite.
