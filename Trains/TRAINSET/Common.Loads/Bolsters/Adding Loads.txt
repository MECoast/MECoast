These loaded will fit into most wagons based on the RCH 1923 5, 7 & 8 plank wagons.

These wagons held 12 tons and the hight of the load depended on the density.
Heave materials such as stone, ballast and spoil would not fill a 7 plank wagon and 3, 4 and 5 plank wagons were used for this traffic. Only when suitable wagons were in short supply would a higher wagon be used - they cost more!

One exception would be the local coal merchant who would often have a sideline in building materials in the summer when heating coal was not in demand.
For this he would use his coal wagons to carry timber, pipes and brick. but if business warrented it, he would also own a 5 plank wagon. In the winter peak it would suppliment his 7 or 8 plank coal wagons.



To use these loads...

Open the wagon folder and make a copy of the empty wagon .wag file.
Rename the copy and the first line of the file by adding _loadname.

eg MY_wagon_stone.wag

Sticking to this renaming comvention will avoid missing wagon errors if one of these loaded wagons is used in an activity.

These models are freeware. You are free to use them as you wish.
However I take no responsibilty if you mess up your installation of MSTS or worse.

Wagon builders may add them to their wagons and upload them but may not change or replace any existing files in the common.loads folder without my or the original author's permission. Additional loads are welcome.
