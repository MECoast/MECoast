The Real Thing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5521 was originally built with parallel boiler under Fowler's tenure as CME for the LMS in 1933 and numbered 5933. It was renumbered 5521 in 1934, and named "Rhyl" in 1937. 

With heavy wartime use taking it's toll, Stanier started a rebuilding programme using taper boiler technology learned from his late 30's "standard" LMS locos, and "Rhyl" was the second converted, in November 1946.  BR added the usual LMR 4 prefix, and it ran on until September 1963.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~


This model as uploaded uses the excellent 3 Cyl Sound Set from Stuart Williamson, not included, but UKTrainsim.com File ID 2896. It also utilises specific sound files which are included as a zip file, together with another Sound readme file inside the archive.


It is provided with two .eng files, the one as first installed using the default Scotsman cab, and another optional setup (ending .BAcab) using the excellent Blue Arrow 8F Cab from the commercial SVR CD.  Feel free to alter the cab used to your preference if you are able. 

As supplied it also has freightanim to David Forrest's Crew Library (various file ID's at UKtrainsim.com). Delete this line in the .eng file with Wordpad if you don't have these or don't want visible crew.


Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.
   

To install, Extract all the files in the archive into your Train Simulator folder, keeping the folder option turned on.  

Then go to the new loco folder in your Trainset folder, find the "Reb_Pat_Sounds.zip" file, and inside it the Sound Readme.txt file, and follow the instructions in this file.  If you have the LMSR CD Locos loaded then you should have these sounds already installed.


A Light Engine Consist is provided, so load up MSTS and go drive it...............


Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the rolling stock that you have available. By default it has Chain couplings, as in reality they did.



DRIVING IT!!!!!!!   PLEASE READ...........
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Loco has been set up to perform as near as possible to the real thing in Manual Firing Mode, while still retaining driveability with Auto Firing.  As it has close to real world settings it needs to be "driven" even in Auto to balance steam output to load, no switch it on and forget it tactics here, it'll bite you!!!!  Handle her with care and she'll fly along with 10 or more on the back, just as they did.

In BOTH modes it has MANUAL dampers, which are set on first loading to keep the fire in check. Use the Damper control key ("M" and Shift "M") to move them to 100% before setting off or steaming will be adversely affected!!!



WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
