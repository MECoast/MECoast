Prototype.

At the start of world war two the goverment took over the private owners wagons. By 1944 the fleet was showing it's age and the goverment asked the wagon builders for suitable replacements.
The LNER and LMS designs were similar but the LMS version had a welded body while the LNER was Riveted.
Charles Roberts submitted a sloping side design.
Most other builders chose one of these designs altho Hurst Nelson built a small batch of there own design at first.
All had Side, End and bottom doors with 4 shoe brake.
The private built wagons were ordered by the Ministry of War Transport and were numbered starting with MWT 1. A few were ordered by private owners and later given numbers in the P series.

A change in design occured in 1947 by the addition of small drop doors above the side doors. This reduced the effort required for unloading but was realy introduced to avoid paying workers extra money.

On nationalisation, BR allocated Diagram 100 to the sloping side design, D101 to the Hurst Nelson design, D102 to the welded design and D103 to the riveted design. The MOT numbers were continued with a B prefix.
BR took over the orders for the top door design and allocated D104 and D105.
They also ordered more of the LMS version as D106.
D106 also added stengthener brackets to the top corners.


Finally the bottom doors were dropped and Diagram 108 was allocated to the privately built wagons with the BR built version allocated D111.
The riveted version was allocated D109.
Without the bottom doors a cross shaft could be used and the two shoe Morton brake was used.


Construction by the private builders continued at a massive rate until 1955 - Pressed Steel alone at one time building 200 a week.

An 8shoe clasp brake vacuum version was introduced in 1951 as D114 but there were problems with loading and unloading gear causing damage.
Customer staff also objected to the added work of coupling and uncoupling.

In the late 50s some D108 and D109 wagons were rebuilt with both 8shoe clasp and 4shoe vacuum brakes.
Conversions continued with both types of brake as demand increased.
The exact details are unknown.
