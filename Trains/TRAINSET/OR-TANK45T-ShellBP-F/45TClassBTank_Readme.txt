45T GLW Class B Tank Wagon.

Version 1
Released 4th Dec 2006

Model and textures by Ian Macmillan.

Class B tanks are used for heavy oils such as used for heating or power station fuel and for bitumen. 
To ease flow the oil was heated before loading and the tanks were lagged.
Because of the weight the tanks were smaller than the class A but the lagging made them look the same size.

The 45ton tanks were introduced in the early 60s and were vacuum braked. In the 70s they were converted to air brakes. About the same time the company emblems were removed - the advertising value had become less than the cleaning cost.
In the 90s the logos reappeared on a few repainted tanks.

Repaints are allowed but please inform me first to avoid duplication. Note that the vacuum and air shapes are different - make sure you use the correct one.
Please seek permission before including this wagon or any repaint on a CD...I might have an upgraded version.
The wagon may not be included on any payware CD without giving me lots of money.
