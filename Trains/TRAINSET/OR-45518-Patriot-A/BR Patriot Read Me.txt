Version 1.1

The player sound files were faulty and a different crew has been used that requires Crew Alias ID 7759 rather than ID 7706.

There is also a patch (File ID: 29388) if you don't want to redownload the whole pack. 




These are all based on TwoManyDJ's unrebuilt Patriot. My thanks go to him for permission to do these.
Also thanks go to Hans Nooyen for permission to include his Royal Scot cab.

The three cylinder sound set (File ID: 2896) is required along with the Crew Aliases (File ID: 7759).

Just run the supplied program to install.



A good spread of allocations has been aimed at.
