The Real Thing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6136 was formerly "Goliath", gaining "The Border Regiment" in 1936, about the time it gained the Stanier Tender. 

It was rebuilt with taper boiler in March 1950.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~


This model as uploaded uses a genuine Whistle sound provided within this pack, and also needs Stuart Williamson's excellent 3 Cyl Sound Set, not included, but File ID 2236 on UKTrainsim.com


It uses the default Scotsman cab, but feel free to alter the cab used to your preference if you are able. 


Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the

To install, Extract all the files in the archive into your Train Simulator folder, keeping the folder option turned on.  

Then go to the new loco folder in your Trainset folder, find the "LMSR_Scot_Sounds.zip" file, and the Sound Readme.txt file, and follow the instructions inside it.


A Light Engine Consist is provided, so load up MSTS and go drive it...............
