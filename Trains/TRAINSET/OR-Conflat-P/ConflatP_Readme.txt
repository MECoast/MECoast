PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~

The Condor was a fast overnight container service between London and Glascow hauled by two Metrovick Co-Bo locomotives.
The standard Conflat A was unsuitable for the high speeds expected and 60 plate wagons were converted by removing the sides and floor and fitting roller bearings. Some had the ends removed depending on condition.
They carried one B container and one smaller A container.
Roller bearing diagram 507 brake vans were allocated to the service.

The service began in March 1959 with 27 wagons weighing 550 tons when fully loaded.
The service did not attract the custom expected and the load was soon reduced. The Co-Bos proved to be unreliable and the train was more often worked by a black 5. By 1961 the service was being hauled by Sulzer type 2s.

In 1964 the wagons were replaced by bogie wagons and most of the conflat Ps were converted to timber P wagons while some of those without the raised end became runner wagons to overhanging loads.
