BR Conflat L wagon with L type containers.
Version 1

Released : 14-06-2006

Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

The L type container was designed to carry 4 tons of powder and were discharged thru bottom doors.
The main use was to carry limestone and dolomite for use as a flux in steel making and this led to the wagons being known as Dollys.
They also carried agricultural lime and so could be seen in rural goods yards.

The first wagon design was diagram 64. 373 were built in 1953 and were similar to the lowfit with drop sides and ends as well as chain pockets.
This was followed by diagram 68 which dispensed wth the sides and ends.1369 were built, the last lots having 8 shoe brakes.

These wagons lasted until the 70s when they were replaced by more modern types.
The wagons usually waited while their containers were unloaded and were rarely seen without them.
When they became redundant they were used as under runners to bolster wagons but are probably most well known for their use attached to diesel shunters to operate track circuits.
