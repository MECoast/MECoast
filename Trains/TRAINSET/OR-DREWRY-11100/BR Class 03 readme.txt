Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy reinstallationtion  process


Open the zip file and extract to your trainset folder using winzip's 'use  folder names' option.

The sound files and cab view will be automatically linked.
