BR Insul Fish Vans.

Version 1

Released : 24-10-2006

Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

The Insul fish van was an LNER design to diagram 214 which did not emerge until after nationalisation. BR built a further batch in 1954 and these recieved diagram 800 in the coaching stock series.
The unusual wheel spacing was to give a 15foot wheelbase which allowed running at up to 75MPH.
The original oil axleboxes were unsuitable for the high speed long distance running expected from these vans (Aberdeen to London in 14 hrs ) and many were given roller bearings denoted by a large blue spot.
BR lost the traffic thru the 60s and they were redundant by the late sixties. Some were transferred to the freight department where they were quickly grabbed by the engineers as tool and packing vans but most were refurbished and put to parcels use.

I have included both oil and roller bearing versions and, since these vehicles were often worked from the smaller fishing ports on the rear of passenger trains, there are also versions with tail lamps.

These wagons were classified as non passenger coaching stock and so will be found in the Passenger Cars section of the editor.
