BR Green Livery

Version 2
Jan 20 2014.

Model ......Ian Macmillan.
Textures....Ian Macmillan.

Version 2 has been re-painted to match Daryn Dunkley's Mk1s and my Bulleid coaches.
Numbers are now done as freigh animations and this has allowed me to add numbered sets.
included are 2coach set 179
3coach set 203
4coach set 204.
The remaining coaches are loose - see consists below.

There are two versions of each coach, one of which is reversed.
Do not flip the coaches in the activity editor as this will not flip the freight animations resulting on wrongly positioned numbers and tail lamps. 

PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~

Few corridor coaches existed on the LBSCR and SECR and the Southern saw an urgent need for replacement of the elderly coaches in use.
The only suitable current design was the LSWR Ironside and Maunsell based his design on these.
They had doors to every compartment to speed loading at suburban stations and small luggage section in the brake coaches.

Clearance problems in North Kent and around Lewes and the Hastings route resulted in three widths being required. 9ft (Restriction 4) for the South Western and 8ft 6in (Restriction 1) for the South East and part of Central.
Restriction 0 were 8ft wide for the Hastings route.
The restriction 4 brake coaches had guards duckets and, to keep them within the 9ft width, the entire luggage section was recessed to 8ft7in. Coaches with doors at the ends also had this reccess to clear the handrails.

Altho most of these problems were gone by nationalisation, most coaches remained in there original area.

Original builds had a broad panel above the windows but from 1929 the hight of the corridor windows was increase to cant rail hight. This gave the coaches their distinctive look.

Electrification gradually reduced their numbers but most lasted into the early 60s.


SR passenger Consists.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The three companies that made up the Southern all used semi-permenant coach sets and the Southern and BR continued the practice.
Some were full trains but most were shorter. 3 and 4 coach sets being the most common.
Loose coaches were added as required.
The usual formation was two 3 or 4 coach sets with loose coaches between.

3 coach sets were BSK-CK-BSK.
4 coach...BSK-CK-SK-BSK or BSK-CK-CK-BSK.

Between these could be added loose coaches- often in pairs.
These could be CK-SK, CK-CK or FK-SK depending on first class requirements.
Further loose coaches would be added as required.

On longer runs a restaurant pair were added consisting of a Kitchen first (RF) and an open second (RSO) The RSO was marshalled at the Kitchen end of the RF with the toilet at the far end.

These rarely ran the full route.
Crossovers in the middle of the platforms at major stations such as Bournemouth and Exeter being provided to quickly remove them.
The LBSCR and SECR did not own any catering cars instead sub contracting to the Pullman company.
The Pullmans were withdrawn during the war and only the full Pullman trains and EMUs returned.
South East passengers went hungry until 1947 when some Buffet cars were converted.

The Southern did not believe in hauling empty seats and few trains kept the same formations all day, droping off or adding coaches and sets as required.

A typical LSWR consist would be BSK-CK-SK-BSK for Weymouth + RF-RSO + BSK-CK-SK-BSK for Bournemouth + BCK-BSK for Lynemouth or Swanage.

Kent coach express 4set + CK-SK + 4set with 3sets at quieter times.

Maximum length was 12 coaches.


Liveries.
~~~~~~~~~

The Southern was colourful in BR days.

A few coaches entered BR ownership in pre-war Maunsell green and these lasted until the early 50s

The livery after the war was a bright Malachite green.
Most coaches were repainted in this livery and early Bulleid coaches emerged from the works in this colour.

BR "blood and custard" came into use in 1949 and the final batch of Bulleids were this livery.

finally BR green came into use in 1957.

The coaches in the fixed sets were repainted together as were the loose twins but no attempt was made to keep full trains the same colour.

Repainting was usually done every 7 to 8 years so only 70% carried blood and custard in 1957, Many coaches went from Malachite to BR green.
1958 was the most colourfull year with all 3 liveries to be seen - often in the same train.

No SR passenger coaches were known to carry BR blue.
