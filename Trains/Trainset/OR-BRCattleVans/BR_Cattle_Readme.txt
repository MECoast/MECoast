PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~~
1200 D352 wagons were built at Swindon in 1949 & 1950 The body was almost identical to the last GW built cattle wagons (W12) but the wheelbase was reduced to 11feet and they were rated 12tons.
A further 1300 followed to diagram 353 in 1951-3. These had a shallower roof profile and no cutouts on the second bottom plank. They reverted to 8 tons.

With the loss of the cattle traffic, many of these vans were used to carry beer barrels.
They began to be withdrawn in the mid 50s altho some lingered on in ale traffic or as vacuum heads or barriers.
