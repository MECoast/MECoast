HISTORY
~~~~~~~

The first Mermaid wagons were ordered in BR's 1952 wagon building program.  However, they closely resebled some wagon purchased by the GWR from Metropolitan-Cammell, who probably owned the patent for this design of side-tipping wagon. 239 unfitted examples, followed by a further 400 vacuum fitted wagons, as represented by this model.


This wagon may also be used to replace one of those removed by Terry Thornton - MermaidWagon01.  I have included a separate ZIP file containing the wag file for those who wish to do this.

Additionally, this package contains loaded and empty wagons.
