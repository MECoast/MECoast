BR Shock Van.
Version 1

Released : 19-11-2006

Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.


The shock absorbing wagon was developed in the 30s to reduce damage to delicate loads by rough shunting.
this was done by attaching the body to the underframe with springs.
To allow for this movement the body was shorted - usually a 16ft 6 body on a 17ft 6 underframe. Patent Dowty two part buffers were also fitted.

The first BR design was to diagram 209 and based on the standard van.
The first lot were built at Darlington and had the LNER style 8 shoe brake.
Later lots had standard 4 shoe brakes. All were vacuum fitted.
Ply or plank was used for the body depending on availability of materials.
Ply was cheaper but any hard knock cracked it requiring expensive replacement of the entire panel. BR compromised by fitting some ply vans with planked doors.

A new diagram D 218 was introduced in 1957 which standardised the ply body and hydraulic or pnumatic buffers but the vans were similar to the previous design. The last batch had BR 8 shoe brake.
Finally D220 was issued for 100 vans with 8shoe brake and pnumatic buffers.
A total of 5175 were built.

The vans were used for delicate items such as glass, bottles both empty and full, pottery, and foodstuff such as biscuits. They could be seen anywhere.

Four models are included to represent the various styles.
