45T GLW Class A Tank Wagon.

Version 1
Released 4th Dec 2006

Model and textures by Ian Macmillan.

Class A tanks are used for petrol, kerosene (aviation fuel) and diesel fuel oil and are subject to strict safety regulations. They were colour coded with a silver or light grey tank and red solebars for easy recognition.
In steam or early diesel days a barrier wagon or wagons no less that 30ft were required between the loco and brake van and the tanks. They were usually marshalled in the middle of the train.

The 45ton tanks were introduced in the early 60s and were vacuum braked. In the 70s they were converted to air brakes. About the same time the company emblems were removed - the advertising value had become less than the cleaning cost.
In the 90s the logos reappeared on a few repainted tanks.

Repaints are allowed but please inform me first to avoid duplication. Note that the vacuum and air shapes are different - make sure you use the correct one.
Please seek permission before including this wagon or any repaint on a CD...I might have an upgraded version.
The wagon may not be included on any payware CD without giving me lots of money.
