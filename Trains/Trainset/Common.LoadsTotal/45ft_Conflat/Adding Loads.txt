NOTE

Sticking to this renaming comvention will avoid missing wagon errors if one of these loaded wagons is used in an activity.

These models are freeware. You are free to use them as you wish.
However I take no responsibilty if you mess up your installation of MSTS or worse.

Wagon builders may add them to their wagons and upload them but may not change or replace any existing files in the common.loads folder without my or the original author's permission. Additional loads are welcome. Please contact me to add your loads to the next Common.Loads update.
