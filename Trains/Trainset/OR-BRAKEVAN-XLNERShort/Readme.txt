BR exLNER diagram 34 & 64 Short Brakevans.

Model :    Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

The first brakevan built by the LNER was a lenghtened version the North Eastern V4 van. It had similar wooded duckets and timber end posts and was rated at 20tons. It was given page 34 in the diagram book.
Darligton built vans had wide planks while some Doncaster vans had narrow planks.

The design was updated in the early 30s to have steel duckets and short steel end posts. All had narrow planks and diag 64 was issued.
In the mid 30s the LNER began to upgrade brake vans by fitting steel duckets and some of the D34 vans recieved them. Some also gained the steel end posts making them identical to D64.

With the introduction of the "Golden Arrow" fast fitted freights, some recieved vacuum brakes but they were found to be unsuitable for fast running. The result was a longer wheelbase D61.  

BR fitted side lamp brackets on the corner posts in place of the previous design on the cabin sides after a van had been destroyed by fire due to leaking lamp oil.


While most company vans stuck to their region, the similarity to the later standard designs saw these vans spreading throughout BR.

This model comes as versions with no tail lamp, a tail lamp for fitted trains, tail and side lamps for unfitted. These show a white lamp forward to ensure the driver that his train is complete in darkness.
A fully detailed interior with a nice warm fire is included. You can view this with the key 5 camera.

The vans also have a passengercapacity of 1.
This allows the activity editor to use the station stop feature and allows freight trains to be timetabled.
Maximum speed for these vans is 45MPH. Any faster and the guard will not be pleased!
