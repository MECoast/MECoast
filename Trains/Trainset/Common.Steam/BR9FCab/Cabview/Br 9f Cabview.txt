BR 9f Cabview Version 1      4 Jan 2008

A BR9f cabview which can be used to relace what ever cabview you are using. Left hand drive.

To install the cab: Unzip the file (I usualy set the download location as the desktop). 

Open the downloaded folder and copy and paste the cabview folder into the loco of your choice. This will over-write the old cabview.

NOTE: If you want to keep the original cabview, rename the folder cabvieworiginal or similar before copying the new cabview.
 

Open the eng file with wordpad or similar.
 
Find the CABVIEW entry. Change this to BR9f.

The reverser looks best with the cut off entry

This isn't necessary to make it work but the handle movement is smoother.

This is my first cab so isn't as good as some on this site (the excellent GWR photo cabs) but as I live abroad my only source is the internet and it doesn't always give what I want. If you don't like it chuck it in the recycle bin.

Anyone is welcome to use the cab or parts without asking my permission.
