Version 1

Released : 27-03-2017

Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

The railway companies tried and failed to convince the coal merchants to use the larger and more efficient 21 ton wagons but had more success with industrial users. They were usually seen in block trains between the larger collieries and power stations, gasworks and steelworks alongside the more common steel versions. The railways also used them for loco coal. 

These wagons survived into the 60s.
