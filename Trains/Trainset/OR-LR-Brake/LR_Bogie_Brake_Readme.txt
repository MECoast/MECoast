Altho coaches like these were uncommon in the UK, similar coaches were included in most wagon and coach builders catalogues. They were easily built using existing body paterns for tramcars mounted on a wagon underframes. Thousands of similar coaches were exported all over the world.

Three coaches are included.
Two vacuum brakes coaches in blue and varnished wood and a red air braked coach for the export market.

The repainters kit insructions included with the LR_Bogie_Coach also apply to these coaches
The instructions also detail how to rename the ace files and edit the reference in the shape file.

Note that the air and vacuum braked coaches use different shape files but the repainting instructions and ace files are common to both.
