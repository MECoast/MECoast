The LNER introduced 50 pipe wagons in 1935/6 to carry iron pipes from the Stanton works at Ilkeston.THey were 8 feet wide and had LNER 8 shoe clasp shoe vacuum brake and given Diagram 103.
A second batch f 100 in 1937 were similar but the width was increase by 4.5in, probably to fit an extra pipe. They were give diag127.
A further batch of 70 was built in 1947.
BR continued the design ordering 300 using the BR diagram 461.

The LMS also served Stanton but their version did not appear until 1949 under BR diag460. THey has similar dimensions but had different door straping and were unfitted with RCH long link 4shoe brake.
They proved to be useful, not only for pipes but for general purposes and construction continued until 1954 with 500 being built.
Under the 1955 modernisation plan, a further batch of 830 were built with vacuum brakes to D462. The final 200 of D462 were given BR 8 shoe clasp brakes.
Most of the unfitted D460 wagons also recieved vacuum brakes during this period. 

Finally 20 more similar to D462 but with hydraulic buffers were built to D463.

The wagons survived into the 80s, some being passed to the engineers department.
