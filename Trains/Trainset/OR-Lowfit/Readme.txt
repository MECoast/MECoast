Prototype
~~~~~~~~~

The Lowfit featured  drop sides and ends. This made it ideal for carrying road vehicles and agricultural machines.
The risk of moving loads pushing open the sides and the lack of chain fixings led to them being banned from carrying containers.

400 wooden bodied wagons were built in 1950 to BR Diagram 001. Altho an LNER design, they were built at Wolverton and so recieved an LMS underframe.

Diagram 002 had a steel body, again with drop sides and ends.
This batch was built at Shildon and recieved an LNER underframe.
1000 were built before the design was changed again to use the Morton 4 shoes brake. 
1200 of these were built but half way thru the build a weakness was noticed in the sides and extra vertical ribs were added.

The final batch of 350 in 1959 had yet another underframe change, being fitted with the BR design of 8 shoe brake.

All 5 varients have been modelled and come with a typical selection of loads.
Additional loads are included to make 90 different wagons.
