English Electric/Napier Prototype Type 5 Co-Co Diesel Electric Locomotive "Deltic".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Built in 1955 at English Electric's Dick Kerr works in Preston, England as a private venture,
DELTIC took the railway world by storm with its unprecedented high power output. It was the
first locomotive to use the new Napier 'Deltic' engines, originally developed for the Admiralty
for use in high-powered motor torpedo boats.

Each of its two Deltic engines comprised 18 cylinders with two opposed pistons turning three
crankshafts geared to a single output shaft driving a DC generator. The cylinder banks were
arranged in the form of a triangle, giving the engine its name.

At the time DELTIC was the most powerful Diesel locomotive in the world.

Deltic entered service in late 1955 on the London Midland Region of British Railways where it 
remained until the end of 1958, working many test trains. From early 1959 it was transferred 
to the Eastern Region where it remained until being withdrawn from service following an engine 
failure in March 1961. By that time the 22 production series locomotives (later called Class 55)
were beginning to enter service on the East Coast Mainline between Kings Cross and Edinburgh.

In the autumn of 1961 a plan to modify the loco for testing in Canada was shelved, and, after
losing some components to the production fleet, DELTIC was externally restored and presented
to the Science Museum, London in 1963, where it remained for the next two decades, before
moving to its present home in the National Railway Museum, York.

I have included a working headlight, the roto-light was a contemporary North American style
so may have been used on DELTIC if the proposed Canadian trials had gone ahead, the headlight
was in reality never used (or even fitted).

Note on authenticity of sound effects, by Stuart Edwards.

The sound effects used for DELTIC are taken from one of the production series locomotives,
and are therefore not strictly accurate for the prototype. After the fitting of electric 
train heating equipment (ETH) to the production locomotives at the start if the 70s, the
leading engine was arranged to pick up speed before the trailing engine. If you listen 
carefully you can hear the effect. Previously both engines operated in tandem, as did the 
prototype's engines, giving a rather different effect. Also, the prototype's generators were 
directly driven (ie. at 1500rpm), whereas the production locomotives' generators were geared 
down to 1,125rpm. The in-cab sound effects for DELTIC should therefore have a higher-pitched
generator 'whine'.

Installation:

Run the installer file DELTIC.exe it will attempt to locate your'e MSTS folder
and install to that.

If you use a non-default path, and it goes wrong (sorry), try installing to another
folder (c:\temp) first and then move the DELTIC folder to your'e trainset folder.

The installation will make an aliased cabview folder (GP38 - sorry), and a sound 
folder with Stuart Edwards sounds, please read his readme "audio_readme.txt".
	
NB If you have the PC Format/Kuju Deltic or Bob Peach's improved version of the cab
you can copy the contents of the cabview folder to the DELTIC cabview folder replacing 
my aliased file "deltic.cvf".
