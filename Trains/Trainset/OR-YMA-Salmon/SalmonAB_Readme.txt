BR YMA 51T Bogie Rail Wagon. Air Braked.

Model and Textures by Ian Macmillan.

Prototype.

Built between 1952 and 1961, these wagons were intended to carry rail and track panels for the engineers but their strong constuction made them useful for many other loads. This strength made them virtually indestructable and many are still in use today.
They were 62ft long in order to carry standard 60ft track panels.
Early examples sat on 5ft 6in wheelbase plate bogies with 2ft 8in diameter wheels.
Later the bogies were extended to 8ft.
By the late 70s unfitted trains were ending and many of these wagons recieved air brakes. At the same time they recieved the current grey and yellow livery but because of the narrow frame most recieved only one of the colours.

Because of the oil bearings, these wagons were limited to 35mph.

Model.

Two wagons are included with 5ft 6 bogies and 8ft bogies.
Versions of each of these are provided with bolsters and loads of rails, Wooden and concrete track panels, giving you 10 wagons.

Operation.

These wagons were mainly used during relaying operations.
A train would arrive on site consisting of an empty flat and loaded wagons of new panels.
A crane would then lift each old panel and place it on the empty, replacing it with a new panel.
The train would then return to the sleeper depot.
Normally, up to 20 panels could be relayed in an overnight possession, loaded on 5 wagons.

On main lines, the new track would have temporary rails. When it had settled, a train would bring in long welded rails to replace the temporary rails which would be returned to the sleeper depot for reuse.

A wooden track panel weighed around 5 tons and each wagon could carry 6. Concrete track was slightly heavier with 5 panels to a wagon.
In practice one less panel was loaded, this allowed the train to be sent over lower axle load routes.
