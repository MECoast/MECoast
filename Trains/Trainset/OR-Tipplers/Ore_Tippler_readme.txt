BR 27 & 26Ton Tippler wagons.

Model ........Ian Macmillan.
Textures....Ian Macmillan.


Prototype.

The first tippler wagons were built to diagram 180 in 1951 and were followed by D181 which only differed by a fraction of an inch in plate thickness. After 2400 had been built it was found that the wagons were being overloaded and so the next batch of 4740 to D183 had the hight reduced by 4 inches.
The next diagram was D184 which had the wheelbase increased to 10feet.. 1450 were built.
Finally 3363 were built to D185 and these were given 8shoe clasp vacuum brakes.

In the late 50s examples from all diagrams obtained secondhand roller bearings while most of D 184 were given clasp vacuum brakes.

They were used for domestic iron ore from Cumbria and the Midlands and also imported ore. As this traffic declined or switched to hoppers, they also began to be used for chalk and sand. 
A hugh increase in aggregate traffic in the 70's saw most of these wagons being transferred to this traffic.
They were finally used for engineer's spoil before being withdrawn in the 90s

4 different models are incuded with ore and stone loads.
