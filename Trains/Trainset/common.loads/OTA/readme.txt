PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~
Follow an upsurge in traffic, the OTA wagons were converted from OCA opens to replace vacuum wagons of a similar design.
The first batch emerged in Railfreight red, but urgent demand for more saw many released in undercoat green.
A batch was painted blue for Thames Board traffic but soon got mixed in with the rest.

The lenght of the logs carried depended on the originating point. The shorter logs loaded in 3 bundles were loaded on the West Highland line.
