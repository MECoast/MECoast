The Q4 class was originally Great Central Class 8A being introduced by J.G.Robinson from 1902. The total number built was 89 ( in its original form ). They were built as a heavy goods loco and proved themselves on the taking of export coal from Yorkshire to the docks at Grimsby and Immingham - 50 laden wagons out and 80 empties back. Little changes on them throughout their lives. The last one being withdrawn in 1959.
