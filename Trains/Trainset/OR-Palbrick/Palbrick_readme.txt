Prototype.

Traditionally bricks were loaded into open wagons by hand. When the brickworks started to use pallets they were too wide to fit the doors on standard open wagons.
At first dropside mediums were used but these were too low sided and a new wagon was designed.
The sides of these were made of two plywood panels with reinforced cutouts for lifting out by forklift truck.
One end had an open frame with screw clamps to secure the load.

Officially the first palbricks were converted from a cancelled order for 400 diagram 19 13 ton medfits in 1957.
However it would seem that some of these entered service as medfits and were replaced by medfits withdrawn from earlier batches, some of which retained their medfit ends.
The first wagons were coded palbrick A and were built on the existing medfit floor giving an internal width of around 7ft 5in.

It would seem the As were too narrow for some pallets and a wider version was built with an internal width of 8ft 3in. These were coded palbrick B and rated 16 tons.
All the wagons so far had 4shoe vacuum brake but the last 90 palbrick Bs recieved BR clasp brakes, Hydraulic buffer and roller bearings.
Finally the brick manufactures seem to have standardised their pallets and the last batch were built only 6ft 6in wide on the improved underframe and were coded palbrick C.
a total of 388 As, 632 Bs and 400 cs were built by 1960.

Until the early 60s the wagons were allocated according to pallet size of the user but with the introduction of the standard narrow pallet all types were mixed, the wider wagons being packed out with old tyres.

A loss of business to road haulage saw most palbricks redundant by the late 60s.
Many were fitted with cradles as coil wagons and some were fitted with bar couplings to act as match wagons to freightliner flats.
In the mid 70s the chassis were used for 16ton mineral wagon conversions.
