First Released : April 2009
Models and skins by : Karl Restall for UKTRAINSIM.COM

Updated for operation in Open Rails and MidEast Coast. The Lamp now weighs only 2Lb and has negligible length of only a few inches. Theres is zero friction calculated by OR as caused by speed, gravity, tunnels or wind. There is zero braking force calculated by OR. The Lamp has negligible effect on the release and application rate for brake operation.

Notes
~~~~~

Two versions of the Tail Lamp are available.

1. MK1TailLamp.wag is for placement after the last carriage in your consist.

2. MK1FrontLamp.wag is for placement before the first carriage in your consist. This useful if you want to do a run round in an activity. You will then have a lamp at the new rear of your train. NOTE: You must reverse the loco for the light to work after a run round by Pressing 'CNTRL E'. Not all MEC Locos have reversible cabs.

Operation
~~~~~~~~~

The Lamp will only operate if you press #H at least once, or twice if needed. All MEC Steam Locos require only one press for the lights to work, but some diesels have the option of stronger lights with a second press.

Some coaching stock in MEC already has a tail lamp integrated into the model, so obviously it is not necessary to use this model with such coaches. MEC coaching stock with Tail Lamp included is always denoted by *****-T.wag in the file name.

The Model is most suitable for the updated Martin Bracegirdle MK1 Coaching Stock that was originally found in MidEast Plus. NOTE: all these coaches have a light integrated but no actual lamp is seen. The integrated lamp will not show as lit if there is a MK1Tail Lamp fitted since the coach is no longer at the rear of the train.
