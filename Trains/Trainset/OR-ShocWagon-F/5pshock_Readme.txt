LMS/BR 5plank Shock Absorbing Wagon.

Version 1
Released 18/11/07

Model by Ian Macmillan.


PROTOTYPE

The shock absorbing wagon evolved in the mid 30s but did not appear in great number until after the war.
The body was attached to the chassis by springs allowing it the move slightly to absorb shocks while being loose shunted.
The wagon was similar to the current design of open wagon but had a shortened body to allow movement.
They were used to carry glass, pottery and earthenware either in crates or packed loose in straw and sheeted over to keep the straw dry. One or two were often seen in country goods yards loaded with clay pipes used for field drains.

The LMS version had corrugated ends with the corrugations facing outward as in the contemporary vans.
Diagram was built from 1938 until 1940 with a further batch after the war. It was unfitted with two shoe Morton brake. Most were converted to fitted by BR.
Diagram 2040, built 1940 was similar but had LMS suspension and 8shoe brake but with a long brake lever to clear the springs.

BR completed the LMS orders before adoping the design as standard but they reversed the ends so that the corrugations and top lip faced inward. This allowed a tarpaulin bar to be fitted.

The first 500 toDiagram040 had the LMS brake and suspension but the remaining 1700  had 4shoe fitted brakes. All had tarpaulin bars.
250 to D048 were similar but without the tarpaulin bar.

1250 to D050 were similar to D048 but were downrated from 13tons to 12t
The 250 to D052 were the tarpaulin bar version of D050.

Finally D056 had LMS clasp brake but without the extra suspension until half way thru the build when BR style clasp brake took over.
Tarpaulin bars were fitted.

To further the confusion, many of those without tarpaulin bars had them fitted while any wagon with a damaged or bent bar often had it removed.

Like most opens, they ended their days in the 70s carrying ballast and spoil.
