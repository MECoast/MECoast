BR diagram 272 Presflo Powder Wagon.

Version 2
Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.


BR introduced the Presflo in 1954 to carry fine powders such as cement.
The problem with cement is that it compacts under it's own weight and becomes almost solid thus preventing it being unloaded by gravity.
The solution was to loosen the load by pumping in compressed air and blowing the cement out.
Almost 2000 of these wagons were built. The use of a portable compressor allowed these wagons to be unloaded anywhere and they were to be seen over much of the country.

The design was also used by private builders.
