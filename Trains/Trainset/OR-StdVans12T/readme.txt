BRITISH RAILWAYS 12T Standard Vans.
Version 3
Model    : Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

The BR standard van was first built in 1951 to Diagram 208. The sides were based on the GWR type but with LMS/LNER pressed steel ends and the shallower LMS roof profile. All were vacuum fitted with Morton 4 shoe brakes.
Some later vans were given ply doors and this design went on to featured BR 8 shoe brakes.
This diagram eventually amounted to 19,063 wagons.

In 1952 a new diagram D213 was issued for similar vans but with all ply bodies. These again featured both types of brake. 3699 were built.

The last batch came in 1961 when 2,000 of D234 were built with ply bodys, 8 shoe brake and Oleo buffers.


Installation.
Before installing this folder please delete any previous version.
Overwriting the previous version will do no harm but will leave surplus files which are not required.

Unzip to a temporary folder and move, copy or drag the folder BR_12T_Standard_Vans to your Trainset folder.
You will require to make a consist to use this wagon.

vERSION 3 has beefier brake gear and modelled springs.
A problem with the roof on some graphic cards has been fixed.

Version 2 features LODs. LODs (Level of detail) specify at what distance a part is shown. These vans are highly detailed and thus have a high poly count. Drawing this detail gives the computer more work to do and so slows frame rates.
By limiting the distace at which this detail is drawn frame rates are improved; after all, why draw it when you can't see it.


Built with Train Sim Modeller.
LODs added with Polymaster.
