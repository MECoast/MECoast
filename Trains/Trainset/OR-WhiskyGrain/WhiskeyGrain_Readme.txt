In 1965 Distillers Co Ltd opened a new maltings at Burghead near Elgin and hired 110 wagons from BRT to carry barley from England. The wagons initially carried a large board on the sides advertising whisky. They joined the older BR fleet until the block train working started in March 1966.
The wagons were loaded at up to 20 locations in the eastern counties and worked by local services to Doncaster where they were mashall into a block train of about 20 wagons departing at 1735. A stop was made at York for wagons from Dunnington and the train arrived at Keith at 0740 the next day where they were worked forward to Burghead by a local trip.
The return working left Keith at 1800 the same day arriving back at Doncaster at 0750.
Other distillers soon joined in and eventually there were 8 workings per week. Pooling of the wagons resulted in the advert boards being removed as the wagons passed thru works.

The traffic lasted until 1980 when BR began to lose the traffic. The wagons were finally replaced by polybulks in 1983.
Most of the wagons were scrapped but a batch were modified to carry alumina from Blyth to Fort William until replaced by air braked wagons in 1988.
