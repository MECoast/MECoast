HISTORY
~~~~~~~
This wagon is based on a standard Railway Clearing House (RCH) design, which was used by numerous
builders to provide wagons for the numerous collieries, coal factors and distributors that existed
betwen the wars. Most were painted in the colourful and varied liveries of their owners. After the
sceond world war, they were all taken over by the new British Railways and most were either repainted
BR unfitted grey, or were pretty much down to the bare wood by then and just had small black panels painted on to accomodate the new numbers.
