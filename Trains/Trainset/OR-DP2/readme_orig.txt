English Electric Type 4 Co-Co Prototype Diesel Electric Locomotive DP2 in original Green Livery

Built in 1961 at the Vulcan Foundry, Newton-le-willows England, using the ninth production Deltic bodyshell, 
DP2 was a testbed for an uprated class 40 engine (16CSVT @ 2700hp), which was later installed in the class 50's.
After a period testing on the WCML, it was transfered to the ECML and became an extra member of the Deltic fleet 
being repainted into two tone Green. Sadly DP2 was damaged beyond ecconomic repair on the 31st July 1967 in a 
collision with a derailed cement train at Thirsk while working the 12:00 Kings Cross to Edinburgh.

Installation:

Run the installer DP2_01b.exe, it will make a new folder "DP2" in your trainset folder, it will also create
the sound and cabview (alisaed GP38) folders. If you have msts installed in a custom location please make a folder "DP2" in your trainset directory before staring and install into that.

NB If you have the PC Format/Kuju Deltic you can copy the contents on the cabview folder to the DP2
cabview folder replacing my aliased file "deltic.cvf".
