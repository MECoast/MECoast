Thank you for downloading this model.

The Q4 class was originally Great Central Class 8A being introduced by J.G.Robinson from 1902. The total number built was 89 ( in its original form ). They were built as a heavy goods loco and proved themselves on the taking of export coal from Yorkshire to the docks at Grimsby and Immingham - 50 laden wagons out and 80 empties back. Little changes on them throughout their lives. The last one being withdrawn in 1959.
	
	The model has a Robinson Railed tender which could be used with the Pom-Pom that I uploded recently.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

NOTE:  This model requires files to be copied from the SCOTSMAN locomotive directory.
ONLY attempt this installation if you fully understand the steps below.

Step 1. In the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory, create a new directory LNER_0-8-0_8A.
Step 2. Now extract all the files listed above into this directory.
Step 3. From the SCOTSMAN directory, copy the directories CABVIEW and SOUND (including their contents) into the LNER_0-8-0_8A directory.

You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this. Some people have commented that consists produced in the MSTS activity editor give coupling errors, if so use Conbuilder - which I consider to be far superior with its ability to do so much more in terms of error checking etc.

The locomotive will be listed as  LNER_0-8-0_8A and the tender as LNER_Rob_Ten_Railed. 

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the rolling stock that you have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

This model is for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way.
