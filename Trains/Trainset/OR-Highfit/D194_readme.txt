LNER Diagram 194 Open.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First built in 1945 this design was a steel bodied version of the standard RCH 5 plank open. It was adopted as a standard design by BR and built in large numbers.

Note on container use.
Open wagons were frequently used to carry containers, the only restriction being a ban on use of dropside or end door wagons. They could, of course, only be loaded to locations with a crane capable of lifting them out. 


Consist
~~~~~~~

Remember the model will not be available in the simulator without a consist. You can create one with activity Editor supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator or better still use Consist Builder.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and  rolling stock that you have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.


THANKS
~~~~~~

  
Thanks to Paul Mitchell for allowing me to use his wagon shape and to Ian Morgan for the BD container.
