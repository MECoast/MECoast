BR Diagram 104 and 107 20ton Pig Iron Wagons

Version 1

Released : 17-10-2006

Model   :   Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

Pig Iron is the direct raw output from an iron smelter. It is cast into ingots and sent for further processing to make steel and other iron products.

Diagram 004 was given to 600 wagons built at Derby in 1954/55 with a heavy duty 4 shoe brake. This was followed by 100 D007 in 1958 which had a similar body but with a 10ft wheelbase. It had BR 8 shoe brake but unusually without the vacuum cylinders.
Some of both types were later fitted with cradles to carry coils and some of the D007s finally got their brake cylinders.
With the introduction of air braked coil wagons, most reverted to pig iron but many went staight into store before being scrapped. Those that survived were among the last unfitted wagons in traffic.
