PO 35T Bogie Chlorine Tank.

Version 1
Released 17th March 2011

Model and textures by Ian Macmillan.

Chlorine is used in the chemical industry and as a bleaching agent in the paper and fabrics industry.
Most rail traffic was by block trains between ICI chemical plants - mainly from the Merseyside area but single tanks were also sent to other locations.
The red stripe on the ends of the tank indicates a pressurised tank.

Two versions are provided, an earlier version with diamond bogies and a later version with plate bogies.
