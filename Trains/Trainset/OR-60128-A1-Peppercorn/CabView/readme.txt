Since I could not find a suitable cabview for the Tornado, I have made one myself.
Using the A4 Mallard cab and pictures I found on the internet. 

Since you cannot have electrical parts on a steam-loco, the AWS sunflower will not work. The Lightswitch on the electrical box at the roof is also not annimated.
I live in Holland, therefore I changed the speedometer to kmh instead of mph.


There are 2 cvf files: TornadoWG, for use in Tornado in worksgray, with iron (not painted) regulator and whistle. 
TornadoAG for use in Tornado or other A1/A2 engines, with red painted regulator and whistle.

Just copy the cabview file into the loco you want to use, and change the 'cabview'in the eng-file to ; TornadoAG (or TornadoWG)

I hope you like it.
