Hi everybody

This is a joint release of the 5BEL EMU in Pullman Livery.
The models have been completed by Jim Gough and myself.

The all electric Brighton Belle, probably one of the most famous trains in the world, began 
running in January 1933. At first it retained the steam hauled name of Southern Belle, changing to the more familiar name in June 1934.  The three 5BEL electric units 2051 - 53 (3051 - 53 from January 1937) were built by Metro-Cammell Ltd. They were the only electric multiple unit Pullman cars in the world. They were also the largest carriages to run on the Southern Railway. Their use was normally confined to the Victoria - Brighton line, plus Sunday excusion trips to Eastbourne. Occasional special runs took the units to other lines on the electrified system.

The 5 car unit formations were as follows:

Unit No		Motor Brake		Third		First		First(reversed)		Motor Brake

3051		289				286			282 		279				    288

3052		291				287			284		    280				    290

3053		293				285			283			281					292

Some records show motor brakes transposed within units. When first built the third class cars were lettered in full "CAR No 86 THIRD CLASS", later abreviated to "CAR No 86". Unit 3052 received bomb damage early in 1941, while the other two units were taken out of service later in the year and stored for the duration of the war. They did not return to traffic till late 1946/early 1947.

Because of the 5 year gap in service, when the 6-PUL/PAN/CITY units were replaced during 1965/1966, the 5BEL units were retained for a few more years. Repainted blue & grey in 1969 and shorn of Pullman Car Company livery, names and insignia, the "Belle" made its final run on April 30th 1972.
A special farewell trip was also made, from Waterloo to Victoria via Portsmouth, Brighton & Eastbourne. All cars have subsequently been sold for preservation.

Note: The Brighton Belle normally ran as a 2 unit, 10 car train comprised of units 3051 and 3052. The unit 3053 was used as a spare during maintenance and othe occasions.

This BR Brighton Belle is different to the original msts SR umber/creme 5BEL Pullman train in the following ways: The thirdclass cars are lettered "Car No XX" instead of the full "CAR No XX THIRD CLASS", steps under the luggage doors, different coloured roofs, horns on the cab roof, yellow rectangle in the front of the locomotive, and a different passenger view located in Car 86.   

We suggest you download all three units.
