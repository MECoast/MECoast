# MidEast Coast

## Scenario

MidEast Coast goes back in time a couple of decades, so we are firmly in the 1950’s Steam Era. As such this was the time when coal was a major part of the UK economy and new power stations were being built, especially in the Midlands and Yorkshire. Several of these are included with extensive additions of the North Midlands and Yorkshire Coal Mines.

The route is not prototypical as there are some facilities that never existed and some have been resurrected from Dr Beeching’s cuts. In particular some of the lost lines of Lincolnshire and Norfolk have been brought back to life enabling more direct excursions to Skegness and Hunstanton.

A short extension to the original MEP layout has been added from Firsby to Spilsby.
