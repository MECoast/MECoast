Most SERVICES are drivable.

Short SHUNTING Operations such as STARTS and RUN Rounds or SHED MOVEMENTS can be driven if desired. If you wish to stay with a specific loco for a return run you may have to wait some time for the next service to begin. if you drive into a pool the next service for that Loco will not necessarily be known and could also entail a signifcant wait.

WATCH SERVICES have been created at several significant locations. These can be used to observe the passage of trains at or near the appropriate location. To change the time to start watching you will need to edit the start time of a WATCH SERVICE in the TIMETABLE EDITOR. From the OpenRails start TOOLS MENU click on OPEN RAILS TIMETABLE EDITOR. Choose either LINCOLSHIRE or STAMFORD and double click after pressing the YELLOW BUTTON with the GREEN ARROW. Most WATCH SERVICES are loctated well towards the left side of the timetable display. BE CAREFUL NOT EDIT ANY NON_WATCH SERVICES. Yoy will have to save any changes to a WATCH service start time. Press the BUTTON to the RIGHT of the YELLOW BUTTON to SAVE a CHANGE.
